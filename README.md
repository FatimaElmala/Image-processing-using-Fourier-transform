# Image-processing-using-Fourier-transform
This project is to practice Fourier transform of different functions and to find the difference between the following two images.

the file is divided into three sections. 
the first section contains the Fourier transform of different sine functions and their plot in both time and frequency domains. 
The second section contains the Fourier transform of a Simple sound wave. In addition, it contains the Fourier transform of an image. 
The third and last section contains the Fourier transform of two images used to get the difference between the two images. In addition, it contains the difference between the two images in the space domain.
